# Trotting algorithm for quadruped using the spotpuppy library
This is an example use of the `spotpuppy` library to control a robot dog. It is programmed to perform a simple trot gait, stand up, and lie down
# Using this code yourself
To start with, you must have the `spotpuppy` package installed (`pip install spotpuppy`) \
Because of the way the `spotpuppy` library is designed, this repo is useful even if you do not have my exact robot dog. All of the walking algorithm is contained in `trotting_robot.py`, for more info on how to use this vist the `spotpuppy` [repo](https://github.com/JoshPattman/spotpuppy)
