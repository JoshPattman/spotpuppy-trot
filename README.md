# Trotting algorithm for quadruped using the spotpuppy library
This is an example use of the spotpuppy library to control a robot dog. It is programmed to perform a simple trot gait, stand straight, and lie down. It uses the spotpuppy python library (pip install spotpuppy)
# Using this code yourself
Some of the code on this repo is specific to my robot (tuning parameters, hardware modules) but the main code (contained in trotting_robot.py) is a spotpuppy.models.quadruped, which means it can be used on any robot. Check out the spotpuppy repo for more info
